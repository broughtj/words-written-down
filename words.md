> _"Truth is interesting chiefly because it is either 'useful' or marvelous, or at least novel. 'Mere' truth, completely establised
> and beyond question, is a commonplace and a bore. Especially, truth is interesting because it is controversial, and in any case
> it is something to be pursued rather than to be possessed."_

> _"Truth is finally a value, and the will to believe the truth, rather than anything else that one might for any other reason
> wish to believe, is the foundation of all morality."_

> _"In my youth it was said that what was too silly to be said may be sung. In modern economics it may be put into mathematics."_
